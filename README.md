a (hopefully efficient) Markdown frontend in "simple OCaml" (i.e., no external dependencies)

This implementation is meant to be more Github Markdown (the one used in Github) than original Markdown (<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>).


----------------

N.B. You probably need to know markdown first if you plan on reading
the parser's source code. This implementation was driven mainly by two
things: the original Markdown syntax documentation
(<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>) and
try-and-see-what-it-produces on
<https://github.com/pw374/sandbox>. Also, I used Pandoc to check its
behaviour sometimes. Now I can say than Pandoc does not really support
Github flavour Markdown even if it pretends to do so.
