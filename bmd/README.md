This directory contains expressions that break Markdown.

For instance:
```
   * Starting a list with 3 spaces and a star.
   * Continuing the list.
  * 2 spaces and a star: are we still in the same list?
```

On Github it renders like this:

   * Starting a list with 3 spaces and a star.
   * Continuing the list.
  * 2 spaces and a star: are we still in the same list?
